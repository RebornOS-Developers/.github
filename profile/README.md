# What is RebornOS ?
**RebornOS** is an *Arch Linux* based distribution whose goal is to make Arch Linux more approachable to **beginners**. We aim to meet the following needs:
1. **Beginner Friendly**: Users generally get more interaction with developers (on Discord and on Forums) than other typical distributions. 
We offer quite a bit more of *hand-holding* for users who need it, including typing out the exact commands in case they are in a situation requiring terminal use.
2. **Close to Arch Linux**: We are very close to Arch Linux under the hood. We just offer an additional package repository as a convenience for installing a select list of popular packages that otherwise would require building from source through the *Arch User Repository* (AUR).
At the installation stage, users can easily deselect all RebornOS apps if they choose to. We do not even brand our desktop environments if you install in the Online mode.
3. **Choice without Bloat**: At the installation stage, users can select from more than a dozen desktop environments, and a choice of several hundreds of packages in the *Advanced* page.
Yet, users can choose to deselect RebornOS apps, the RebornOS base packages and any other packages they choose to not have. 
There is a high level of customization possible so that one gets an installed system that is as lightweight, or as heavy as they desire.
After installation, we even provide assistance to users who want to convert their RebornOS to vanilla Arch Linux.
4. **GUI friendly**: We understand that not everyone is comfortable with the terminal-based lifestyle. 
We are Graphical User Interface (GUI) friendly and offer GUI apps for various system tasks, including `pamac` for package management.
